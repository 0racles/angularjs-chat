<!-- START: MAIN TUTORIAL CONTENT -->
<div class="container tutorial-content">
    <h2>AngularJS Chat Tutorial</h2>
    <p>
        This tutorial is for you
        if you are a <strong>software developer</strong>.
        Specifically an Angular JS software developer.
        This walk-through is open source and free,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT</a> style.
        You can also get started with the

        <a href="https://github.com/stephenlb/angularjs-chat"
            >AngularJS Chat GiHub repository</a>.

        Or you can use NPM/Bower packages to acquire the dependencies you 
        need to follow along.
        
        <code>bower install angular-chat</code> is the preferred.
        You can also use
        <code>npm install angular-chat</code>.
    </p><p>
        So why is chat important? Well for one thing,
        nothing kills customer experience more than when they can't
        communicate with a company when trying to purchase a product.
        A modern way to exceed the expectations of your customer's experience
        is actually simple.
        Chat communication.
        When your customers are easily able to communicate with you,
        your sales and business metrics shift.
        Immediately obtaining information allows a customer to move forward
        with purchasing decisions with little effort.
        The customer's experience is seamless.
        We humans use chat to communicate.
        Chat is what we are good at.
        And that makes things easy.
    </p><p>
        We will be live streaming and live coding.
        The example AngularJS Chat app will be built live with you watching.
        We will answer your questions live.

    <p>
        Building chat communication is difficult.
        There are a lot of challenges you need to overcome.
        Building chat applications with AngularJS is extremely rewarding.
        It make maintenance of your chat apps simple.
        That is because when you need to add new features to your
        Angular application, it is a breeze.
        With the upcoming AngularJS 2 framework the level of
        abstraction used to simplify application development
        will make your life easy as the developer.
    </p><p>
        The purpose of this tutorial is to help you build AngularJS
        modules and extensions for chat communication.
        And soon you're application can communicate with your
        users and among your users too.
        With both AngularJS 1.5 and AngularJS 2 modules enabling
        messaging experiences in your app on mobile iOS/Android and web.
        That is the promise of this walk-through.
    </p><p>

        We will start the code section of this walkthrough.
        And you will need the: 
        <a href="https://github.com/stephenlb/angularjs-chat">
            AngularJS Chat GitHub Repository</a>.

        You can also 
        <code>bower install angular-chat</code> or
        <code>npm install angular-chat</code>.
        We are using bower in the example.
        Make sure to include your JavaScript dependency files.

        You need <strong>PubNub API Keys</strong>.
        This allows the chat communication on a data stream network.
        You can fill in the
        <code>YOUR_PUBLISH_API_KEY</code> and
        <code>YOUR_SUBSCRIBE_API_KEY</code> placeholder
        strings  with your API keys that you get on the PubNub website.
    </p><p>
        Now that you have the prerequisites and your PubNub API keys
        we are ready for the next part.
        Here's an example on how to <strong>send</strong> and
        <strong>receive</strong> a message within your AngularJS app.
        First we will start with accessing the AngularJS Chat Model methods.
        This code is a simple controller.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="angular-chat-logo">Controller for AngularJS Chat</h3>

    <p>

{% highlight javascript %}
// =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
// Minimal Chat Controller
// =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
var chat = angular.module( 'BasicChat', ['chat'] );
chat.controller( 'chat', [ 'Messages', function( Messages ) {
    // - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    // Message Inbox
    // This array will hold the messages
    // ordered by receipt.
    // - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    this.messages = [];

    // - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    // Receive Messages
    // Push to Message Inbox.
    // - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    Messages.receive(function(message){
        this.messages.push(message);
    });

    // - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    // Send Message
    // This is a controller method used
    // when a user action occurs.
    // Also we expect a model reference
    // ng-model="chat.textbox".
    // - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    this.send = function() {
        Messages.send({ data : chat.textbox });
    };
} );
{% endhighlight %}

    </p><p>
        Wait was it really that easy? Boy howdy.
        There are a couple more things that you need
        to do in preparation to add chat in your application.
        Good to know the entry points of sending and receiving 
        chat messages.

        Now you can send receive JSON messages.
        Oh right forgot to mention.
        The messages are automatically encoded in JSON.
    </p><p>
        A simple controller for messaging applications only needs one
        model reference: <code>this.messages</code> array.
        The messages array can hold all of the messages.
        And you can have them displayed on the application user interface.
        Anytime a new message arrives,
        it will be pushed into the messages array.
        When we apply this to an HTML view,
        messages will be displayed to the user.
        Here is the code for displaying Messages to the user.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="angular-chat-logo">HTML View for AngularJS Chat</h3>

    <p>

{% highlight html %}
<!-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<!-- Chat View in HTML -->
<!-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<div ng-controller="chat">
    <div ng-repeat="message in chat.messages">
        {% raw %}{{ message.user.name }}:{% endraw %}
        {% raw %}{{ message.data }}{% endraw %}
    </div>
    <form ng-submit="chat.send()">
        <input ng-model="chat.textbox">
    </form>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

    </p><p>
        This simple AngularJS view has two parts.
        The first part is a messages display area.
        The second part is user input for sending messages.
        When a user submits their text,
        the controller will deliver this message for you using the
        <code>Messages.send()</code> method.
        Pretty neat, yah?
        You will also want to set user information along
        with that message payload.
        This is important because you need to identify who sends the message.
        You can do that by invoking the <code>Messages.user()</code> method.
    </p><div class="samus-aran">

{% highlight html %}
// - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
// Set User Data
// - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Messages.user({ name : "Samus Aran" });
{% endhighlight %}

    </div><p>
        You can put anything inside the object that is JSON serializable.
        This information will become accessible with each message sent.
        You can display this information in the HTML view.
        Internally we call this information
        <strong>chat message meta data</strong>.
        It will remain associated with each message sent.
        As of this tutorial, older messages will retain the
        original meta data information.
        This means if a user updates their name or info that it will
        not be propagated to the older chat messages.
    </p><p>
        In the HTML view, you can access the user data like this:
    </p><p>

{% highlight html %}
<!-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<!-- User Data in HTML View -->
<!-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
{% raw %}Your name is {{ message.user.name }}{% endraw %}
{% raw %}The thing is {{ message.user.other_thing }}{% endraw %}
{% raw %}Bar {{ message.user.foo }}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

    </p><p>
        With all these parts combined you have a basic chat application!
        However it is not actually complete and there's more that needs
        to be done in order to ensure excellent user experience.
        Pretty UI is what I'm referring to.
        Beautiful user interface is helpful indeed.
        Our demo application includes some advanced CSS3 snazziness.
        CSS3 animations and flex box are used in our
        <a target="_githubapp3" href="/tutorials/angularjs-basic-chat-module/app">
        basic AngularJS chat app</a>.
        It is 2016 and we are now in the future.
        Browsers on modern operating systems include the ability
        to understand how to display flex box and render CSS3 animations.
        This makes our life easypeasy.
        Whoopee!
    </p><p>
        I like making pixel perfect user interfaces and experiences.
        Web browsers vendors with CSS3, HTML5 and
        JavaScript have not always provided
        a consistent user experience.
        But it's better now!
        You don't realize how awesome
        this makes your application development speed.
        I will work with you and show you what modern 2016 technology
        can yield in terms of awesomeness.
        But only a preview for you.
    </p>

    <h3 class="flex-box-css3">Flex Box with AngularJS</h3>

{% highlight html %}
<!-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<!-- Flex Box Example -->
<!-- =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= -->
<style>
    div.parent-container { display: flex; }
    div.child-span       { flex: 1;       }
</style>
<div class="parent-container">
    <div class="child-span"> 1 </div>
    <div class="child-span"> 2 </div>
    <div class="child-span"> 3 </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        One of the modern technologies is <strong>flex box</strong>.
        If you have not used flex box before, you should!
        Before there was flex box you hatch to combine your HTML CSS
        and JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements to your design desires.
        Now with flex box, the browser render engine will take care of
        this for you when you use a few CSS3 directives.
    </p><p>
        I thought flex box would end up being more complicated.
        But it is simple and works phenomenally for multiple
        screen sizes and media queries.
        Flex box fulfills my desire to developer to maintain proper
        abstraction between the <strong>view layer</strong>
        the <strong>styling layer</strong> the controller and the model.
    </p>

{% highlight css %}
/* =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= */
/* Mobile View CSS3 - using Media Queries */
/* =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= */
@media (max-width: 500px) {
    div.parent-container { flex-direction: column; }
}
{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        Flex box for the win.
        You can change the order of display for elements.
        And you don't have to change the HTML!
        Simplicity achieved.
        The alternative is a variety of CSS3 display type conditions.
        Flex box is offers improved simplicity when
        you are programming for web apps.
    </p><p>
        We showed you a few critical snippets of the basic chat application.
        You will want more beyond the basic chat experience for your users.
        That is why a more advanced application
        has been built for you to copy.

        It is only a starting point.
        There's more to come.
        The plan is to use the AngularJS 1.5 Chat Module as a starter for 2016.
        We'll be moving to Angular 2 going forward.

    <h3 class="angular-chat-logo">Who uses Chat?</h3>

    <p>
        There are many companies with chat.
        Many chat apps.
        They all do the chat thing.
        Some folks are chat exclusive.
        And some use chat to augment and improve
        user experience in the application.
        You can chat between live broadcasters and the audience members.
        Chat is fundamentally how we communicate as humans.
        Building chat applications is difficult.
        Now it is less difficult now that you have read this walkthrough.

    <h4>Periscope and Meerkat</h4>
    IMG IMG IMG

    </p><p>
        Periscope and Meerkat grant you the ability of teleportation.
        Distant places on Earth no longer apply.
        You now can join broadcasters in their experiences as they
        record video in realtime using their own phone.
        You get a chance to see what they see.
        Partly because they are potentially thousands of miles away 
        there are only a few methods available
        for communicating with a broadcaster.
        <strong>Chat</strong>.
    </p><p>
        Chat enables viewers to communicate with the broadcaster.
        The broadcaster might be a journalist.
        A journalist filming political things, probably.
        You might want to ask questions to the broadcaster.
        Chat allows you to do this.
        Both Meerkat and Periscope include chat communication
        between broadcaster and viewer audience.
        Both of these Apps are native so they don't use AngularJS of course.
        However these apps could have been built with AngularJS in mind.
    </p>

    <h4>TwitchTV and YouTube LIVE!</h4>

    IMG IMG IMG

    <p>
        I have been watching Twitch TV.
        It is entertaining as a gamer.
        I played SNES games and modern games.
        Like Super Metroid and aid Mega Man/X.
        And PlayStation with Resident Evil series and Final Fantasy series.
        I like watching streamers play these games.
        It's much easier to just hang back and turn
        on the stream other favorite game; rather than playing myself.
        This experience additionally includes the ability to chat
        with the gamer as they play live.
    </p><p>
        I don't often use the sidebar chat.
        I read the comments from the audience members.
        Chatting with the broadcasters is generally satisfying.
        I can imagine building these apps using AngularJS!
        Adding a sidebar chat experiences for audience interactivity
        is easy with <code>angular-chat</code> module.
    </p>

    <h4>Slack, Flowdock and BaseCamp</h4>

    IMG IMG IMG

    <p>
        Working with my team at PubNub, we communicate through team chat. Slack flow dock and base camp are among the more popular team chat applications. We also use Skype and a little bit of salesforce team chat. Primarily I use hello dock and slack throughout the day other teams use base camp here at PubNub. Starting to see why chat is such a big deal for humans in 2016. The apps are HTML browser-based applications group chats. They'll have mobile apps so you can communicate with your team with mobile app chat. I would definitely right Slack app using AngularJS.

    Intercom.io Olark UserVoice Help Desk Support

    IMG IMG IMG

    There're a lot of situations we're basic customer support is not satisfied buying email. Having chat on your app or on your website is proven to increase customer interactivity with the business. As a developer I definitely don't like speaking to sales guys that sales guy has an agenda and I don't want to hear it. But if I have a question I always ask support for help. And if I see chat I will always use chat to contact customer support. If your business online with an app or website make sure you have chat interactivity.  Customer support is typically in the category of one-to-one chat.

    WhatsApp Snapchat

    Replacing SMS with over-the-top messaging and allowing users to communicate using phone numbers as their identity was a pretty smart idea for an app. Looks like WhatsApp was able to accomplish this pretty well.  They were able to defeat SMS and offer IP messaging act and unbeatable pricing great. They've built a simple chat application the meeting easy for people to text each other. They don't something that is the most basic example of chat. I wonder why Skype wasn't able to accomplish this. I suppose Skype WhatsApp and snapchat are completely different genres.  The are all one-to-one chat options.

    You can do a lot more with chat. We haven't covered doctor-patient communication with hip compliance privacy and enterprise grade encryption security. There's also food order delivery service that allows you to Courtney and check on your delivery status light with Instacart and Eat24. We also have DoorDash, SpoonRocket and PostMates.  These applications benefit greatly from direct access to support staff through chat.

    Features including in AngularJS Basic Chat

    There're a lot of freebies you get by importing a module and using it in your AngularJS app. Life is easy. One of the more difficult things to get right in application development is security. Security is included by default and for free. User communication security is paramount in chat applications. AES cryptography and TLS termination help secure encrypt user communication over the WAN. In addition to message body encryption, we also have to deal with message integrity and identity verification of the sender. How can you tell if the sender really is too they say they are. You needs to be old to confirm their identity. The best way to do that is through message signatures. You can also call these digital signatures LINK LINN LINK stackoverflow. This is done by creating and maintaining a secret on the client in sharing a public key that is maintained by in identity verification service. We had not included this feature yet. We will. Don't forget about identity authentication and authorization. When a user logs into their chat using their email and password that is called authenticating a user. After a user has been authenticated, they will receive a token known as a session ID. This session ID is a long unpredictable string representing randomized characters. This session ID will be used along with every REST Service call. Using the session ID is in a process called authorization. This is the phase where we check the session ID that has been validated in the authentication step. If the session ID is valid, we will look up the user permissions and allow them to pass returning a successful payload because they have been authorized.

    Even though it's the future and we have hover boards, Internet connectivity is often spotty and is absolutely unreliable in many situations. Especially when driving. Especially when walking around in the shopping mall. You need a reliable datastream network to provide message delivery. Even when your Internet disconnects your messages will still be delivered. This is called message recovery after disconnect and reconnect. Well there are many mechanisms to allow for message redelivery, we found at high scale networking becomes a big fun challenge. By default and currently the Best option we've included PubNub in AngularJS chat to solve this need.

    Long-term message storage requires is significantly different technical solution than short-term message redelivery. We've also use pub knob to help us solve for this. They have an infrastructure built with fault tolerance in mind. What they do is have 20+ data centers that maintain copies of your chat messages encrypted on a secure network. Angular JS chat Will make a REST call to the closest of the 20 data centers and receive historical message chat history.

    You may have noticed in the test application demo that message delivery is lightning fast. This is because we are using a network that is called PubNub. This network leverages many points of presence around the planet to deliver relay insecure message transfer in less than a quarter of a second. When we talk about the Doherty threshold we are referencing appoint at less than 400 ms where human perception of real-time begins. Being able to achieve instantaneous delivery of messages is a special capability that this network provides no matter where you are on earth.

    conclude

    I'm really excited to build the next phases of AngularJS chat. So much more to come. To be building and replicating many well-known chat applications.
