<!-- START: MAIN TUTORIAL CONTENT -->
<div class="container tutorial-content">
    <p>
        Quickly. I need to say that this tutorial is for you
        if you are a <strong>software developer</strong>.
        Specifically an Angular JS software developer.
        This walk-through is dedicated to being open source and free.
        To get started you can start with the

        <a href="https://github.com/stephenlb/angularjs-chat"
            >AngularJS Chat GiHub repository</a>.

        Or you can use NPM/Bower packages to acquire the dependencies you 
        need to follow along.
        
        <code>bower install angular-chat</code> and also
        <code>npm install angular-chat</code>.
    </p><p>
        So why is chat important? Well for one thing,
        nothing kills customer experience more than when they can't
        communicate with a company when trying to purchase a product.
        A modern way to exceed the expectations of your customer's experience
        is actually simple.
        Chat communication.
        When your customers are easily able to communicate with you,
        your sales and business metrics shift.
        Immediately obtaining information allows a customer to move forward
        with purchasing decisions with little effort.
        The customer's experience is seamless.
        We humans use chat to communicate.
        Chat is what we are good at.
        And that makes things easy.
    </p><p>
        We will be live streaming and live coding.

        Building chat communication is difficult.
        There are a lot of challenges you need to overcome.
        Building chat applications with AngularJS is extremely rewarding.
        It make maintenance of your chat apps simple.
        That is because when you need to add new features to your
        Angular application, it is a breeze.
        With the upcoming AngularJS 2 framework the level of
        abstraction used to simplify application development
        will make your life easy as the developer.
    </p><p>
        The purpose of this tutorial is to help you build AngularJS
        modules and extensions for chat communication.
        And soon you're application can communicate with your
        users and among your users too.
        With both AngularJS 1.5 and AngularJS 2 modules enabling
        messaging experiences in your app on mobile iOS/Android and web.
        That is the promise of this walk-through.
    </p><p>

        We will start the code section of this walkthrough.
        And you will need the: 
        <a href="https://github.com/stephenlb/angularjs-chat">
            AngularJS Chat GitHub Repository</a>.

        You can also 
        <code>bower install angular-chat</code> or
        <code>npm install angular-chat</code>.
        We are using bower in the example.

    </p><p>
        Letâ€™s jump straight to it.
        Here's an example on how to <strong>send</strong> and
        <strong>receive</strong> a message within your AngularJS app.
        First we will start with accessing the model's methods.
        Then we'll show you a simple controller example.
    </p><p>

        CODE CODE CODE

    </p><p>

    Wait was it really that easy? No. There're a couple things that you need to do in preparation to make this work in your application. But it's important to know the entry points of sending and receiving messages for chat communication.  Now that you can send receive JSON on messages let's take a look at how you can add this to a AngularJS controller.

    CODE COD ECODE

    A simple controller for messaging applications only needs one model reference. That is a messages array that holds all of the messages to be displayed on the application message user interface. Anytime a new message arrives, it will be pushed into the messages are ready. When we apply this to an HTML view, Messages will be displayed to The user. Here is the code for displaying Messages to the user.

    CODE CODE CODE

    This simple view has two parts to it. The first part is a messages display area. The second part is user input for sending messages. When a user submits their text, the controller Will deliver this message for you. Pretty neat Ha? Now you will also want to set user information along with that message payload. This is important because you need to identify who sends the message. You can do that by invoking the messages user method.

    PUBNUB 

    you need pub nub account.  signup get keys and paste api keys here.

    CODE CODE CODE

    With all these parts combined you have a basic chat application. However it is not complete there's more that needs to be done in order to ensure excellent user experience. Hey beautiful user interface is helpful indeed. Our demo application includes some advanced CSS three. CSS three animations in CSS three flex box are used in our basic chat application. Because it is 2016, We are in the future, and all browsers on modern operating systems include the ability to understand how to use flex box and CSS three animations. This removes the need for CSS3 compilers like LESS and SASS.  Whoopee.

    CODE CODE CODE

    I like making pixel perfect user interfaces and experiences. Web browsers CSS HTML and JavaScript have not been great consistently across browsers and vendors,. And it's so awesome you don't realize how awesome. I work with you and show you what modern Technology in 2016 can yield in terms of awesomeness. One of the modern technologies is flex box. If you have not used Xbox before, You should. Before flex box you hatch to combine your HTML CSS and JavaScript to align and expand HTML elements to your design desires. But with flex box the browser render Will take care of this for you buy a few CSS three directives. Sheer are those CSS three directives


    CODE CODE CODE


    I really thought flex box would end up being more complicated than this. But it really is simple and works phenomenal for multiple screen sizes and media queries. Flex box fulfills my desire to developer to maintain proper abstraction between the view layer the styling layer the controller and the model. Flax box for the win.

    So I only showed you a few snippets of important aspects of building a basic chat application. You'll wants amora bust basic chat experience for users. So I built a full application that's ready for you to copy. Here is the link to the get hub repository that has all the JavaScript CSS. Don't worry we will start here. There's a lot more to come. This is the first in 2016. Angie needed to get started with a basic chat application written in an get a chance. Also and get into module Will become available. But first let's start with the production grade and get a JS 1.5.

    Who uses Chat?

    There're so many companies. So many apps. They all have chat. They're dedicated to check. Some are only chat. Some used check to augment and improve user experience in the application. Some augment bailon uses to communicate with broadcasters. Chat is how we communicate as humans. Building chat applications is difficult or it wasn't before you read this walk through.

    Periscope and meerkat

    IMG IMG IMG

    Periscope and meerkat are to I was in android applications that allow you to teleport two different places on earth you can join broadcasters in their experiences as they film on sites using their own phone. You get a chance to see what they see. Since they're potentially thousands of miles away a crossed great expenses into a distances there're only a few options available for speaking with a broadcaster. Chat. Check your vacation enables participants and viewers on streams to communicate with the broadcaster. The broadcaster might be a journalist. A journalist filming political thingies. You might want to ask questions directly to the broadcaster. Chat allows you to do this. Both meerkat and periscope include chat indication between broadcaster and viewer audience. Both of these Apps are native so they don't need AngularJS of course. However these apps could have been built with AngularJS in mind.

    Twitch.TV LiveStream and YouTube LIVE

    IMG IMG IMG

    I got more into twitch TV these days. It's really entertaining for me gamer. I grew up playing old SNES games like supernatural aid mega max. Also PlayStation and Resident Evil series and Final Fantasy series. I like watching streamers play these games. It's much easier to just kick back turn on the stream other favorite game. One of the co-parts of this experience allows me to check back with the game player using chat. Typically you'll see very high quality streams these days with capture cards and HD cameras streaming at 1080p at 60 frames per second. I don't often use the sidebar chat. But I do read the comments from other viewers. Chat and broadcasts prove to be quite satisfying. I can imagine building these apps using AngularJS and adding sidebar chat experiences for audience interactivity with the broadcaster.

    Slack Flowdock BaseCamp

    IMG IMG IMG

    Working with my team at PubNub, we communicate through team chat. Slack flow dock and base camp are among the more popular team chat applications. We also use Skype and a little bit of salesforce team chat. Primarily I use hello dock and slack throughout the day other teams use base camp here at PubNub. Starting to see why chat is such a big deal for humans in 2016. The apps are HTML browser-based applications group chats. They'll have mobile apps so you can communicate with your team with mobile app chat. I would definitely right Slack app using AngularJS.

    Intercom.io Olark UserVoice Help Desk Support

    IMG IMG IMG

    There're a lot of situations we're basic customer support is not satisfied buying email. Having chat on your app or on your website is proven to increase customer interactivity with the business. As a developer I definitely don't like speaking to sales guys that sales guy has an agenda and I don't want to hear it. But if I have a question I always ask support for help. And if I see chat I will always use chat to contact customer support. If your business online with an app or website make sure you have chat interactivity.  Customer support is typically in the category of one-to-one chat.

    WhatsApp Snapchat

    Replacing SMS with over-the-top messaging and allowing users to communicate using phone numbers as their identity was a pretty smart idea for an app. Looks like WhatsApp was able to accomplish this pretty well.  They were able to defeat SMS and offer IP messaging act and unbeatable pricing great. They've built a simple chat application the meeting easy for people to text each other. They don't something that is the most basic example of chat. I wonder why Skype wasn't able to accomplish this. I suppose Skype WhatsApp and snapchat are completely different genres.  The are all one-to-one chat options.

    You can do a lot more with chat. We haven't covered doctor-patient communication with hip compliance privacy and enterprise grade encryption security. There's also food order delivery service that allows you to Courtney and check on your delivery status light with Instacart and Eat24. We also have DoorDash, SpoonRocket and PostMates.  These applications benefit greatly from direct access to support staff through chat.

    Features including in AngularJS Basic Chat

    There're a lot of freebies you get by importing a module and using it in your AngularJS app. Life is easy. One of the more difficult things to get right in application development is security. Security is included by default and for free. User communication security is paramount in chat applications. AES cryptography and TLS termination help secure encrypt user communication over the WAN. In addition to message body encryption, we also have to deal with message integrity and identity verification of the sender. How can you tell if the sender really is too they say they are. You needs to be old to confirm their identity. The best way to do that is through message signatures. You can also call these digital signatures LINK LINN LINK stackoverflow. This is done by creating and maintaining a secret on the client in sharing a public key that is maintained by in identity verification service. We had not included this feature yet. We will. Don't forget about identity authentication and authorization. When a user logs into their chat using their email and password that is called authenticating a user. After a user has been authenticated, they will receive a token known as a session ID. This session ID is a long unpredictable string representing randomized characters. This session ID will be used along with every REST Service call. Using the session ID is in a process called authorization. This is the phase where we check the session ID that has been validated in the authentication step. If the session ID is valid, we will look up the user permissions and allow them to pass returning a successful payload because they have been authorized.

    Even though it's the future and we have hover boards, Internet connectivity is often spotty and is absolutely unreliable in many situations. Especially when driving. Especially when walking around in the shopping mall. You need a reliable datastream network to provide message delivery. Even when your Internet disconnects your messages will still be delivered. This is called message recovery after disconnect and reconnect. Well there are many mechanisms to allow for message redelivery, we found at high scale networking becomes a big fun challenge. By default and currently the Best option we've included PubNub in AngularJS chat to solve this need.

    Long-term message storage requires is significantly different technical solution than short-term message redelivery. We've also use pub knob to help us solve for this. They have an infrastructure built with fault tolerance in mind. What they do is have 20+ data centers that maintain copies of your chat messages encrypted on a secure network. Angular JS chat Will make a REST call to the closest of the 20 data centers and receive historical message chat history.

    You may have noticed in the test application demo that message delivery is lightning fast. This is because we are using a network that is called PubNub. This network leverages many points of presence around the planet to deliver relay insecure message transfer in less than a quarter of a second. When we talk about the Doherty threshold we are referencing appoint at less than 400 ms where human perception of real-time begins. Being able to achieve instantaneous delivery of messages is a special capability that this network provides no matter where you are on earth.

    conclude

    I'm really excited to build the next phases of AngularJS chat. So much more to come. To be building and replicating many well-known chat applications. Some of them were mentioned in this walk-through. Subscribe and follow below to receive the next walk-through.
