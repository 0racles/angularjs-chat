## Running the Website

You may want to run the website or some of the tutorial apps.
You can run the website locally by executing Jekyll server.

```shell
jekyll serve
```

This will launch the Jekyll Server so you can access files locally.
Typically the server will launch an entry point on
[http://0.0.0.0:4000/](http://0.0.0.0:4000/).
